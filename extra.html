                    <h2>PC Crash / Error Fixes</h2>

                    <h3>Graphics Driver Crash during use with Nvidia RTX 3070TI</h3>
                    <p>Problem: After ~30 of gameplay of high framerate gameplay (VALORANT), graphics drivers crash, requiring full system reboot.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Change PCIe mode in BIOS from Auto or PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 3.</p>
                    <p>Diagnosis: It seems like the problem was caused by using a PCIe Gen 3 riser cable with a PCIe Gen 4 Motherboard slot.</p>
                    <p>System Information: X570 AORUS ELITE, Ryzen 7 3700X, EVGA RTX 3070TI FTW3, Lian Li PC011 Dynamic (Source of Riser Cable)</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Intermittent BSOD / Blue Screen System Crashes with Ryzen 5 3600</h3>
                    <p>Problem: System will crash at random with various error codes, requiring full system reboot.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Change Windows power plan from Ryzen (Balanced) to Balanced.</p>
                    <p>Diagnosis: Looks like an issue with the AMD-supplied power plans causes the CPU unit to crash. Changing to a windows power plan such as High Performance or Balanced reduces BSOD frequency drastically.</p>
                    <p>System Information: B350M PRO VDH, Ryzen 5 3600, EVGA RTX 2060 Super XC ULTRA</p>
                    <h3>Update:</h3>
                    <p>I ended up having BSOD's at a huge frequency, usually when my CPU wasn't under load. Whenever I left my PC idle for more than a couple minutes, I would get a BSOD.</p>
                    <p>Hopping into the BIOS and disabling PBO, and enabling AMD Cool n Quiet seems to have solved my BSOD's for good.</p>
                    <p>This probably has something to do with how old my mobo is, but what can you do. Swapping mobos is a pain.</p>

                    <h2>ASUS Zephyrus G14 Fixes</h2>

                    <p>I've had a 2021 G14 for a little bit now, and while its a great laptop with great specs, it also has a habit of running hot, loud, and sometimes the Wi-Fi card breaks.</p>
                    <p>I tried playing Overwatch 2 while plugged into my 240hz monitor, and the raw performance was great. It was pushing 250+ FPS no problem, but the CPU temps were averaging in the high 90's. Probably could've cooked an egg on it.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Wi-Fi Card Not Functional After Boot</h3>
                    <p>Problem: Wi-Fi network list simply does not exist, as the laptop does not recognize that a Wi-Fi card is present.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Unplug anything from the laptop, and hold the power button for 60 seconds.</p>
                    <p>Diagnosis: I'm a hardware geek but laptops are beyond me. Regardless, holding the power button for 60 seconds apparently reset the Wi-Fi card, and most likely other present components. Had to dig around r/G14 for this solution.</p>
                    <p>System Information: 2021 G14, RTX 3060, Ryzen 9 5900HS</p>

				<p>Hello!</p>

				<div>

				<p>My name is Julien, my friends call me Jolan. It's a nickname that stuck, and ended up as a pseudonym I use for most of my online activity.</p>
				<p>This is an extremely early-stage rough draft for my personal website.</p>
				<p>I'm currently studying Software Development at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.</p>
				<p>I've always had a passion for tehnology and computers. From a young age, I was often glued to my dad's old AMD Athlon 62 X2 rig trying to find free video games and video editing software.</p>
				<p>During my school career, I've found a passion for web development and aspire to be a skilled Full-Stack Developer. Hopefully by that point, this website will be much more sophisticated.</p>
				<p>Some of my favorite passtimes include music production with FL Studio, video editing with VEGAS Pro 17, and I also am really into game modding. I've spent an ungodly amount of time building and troubleshooting modlists for Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas. </p>
				<p>I inherited a love for progressive rock from my dad, but have an appreciation for music of all genres. I mainly isten to electronic music when I'm coding.</p>

				<p>Other than that, my

                    <p>Most of these were found through trial and error and/or extensive googling.</p>
                    <p>If I can save you some time with one of these solutions, then mission accomplished!</p>

                    <h2>PC Crash / Error Fixes</h2>

                    <h3>Graphics Driver Crash during use with Nvidia RTX 3070TI</h3>
                    <p>Problem: After ~30 of gameplay of high framerate gameplay (VALORANT), graphics drivers crash, requiring full system reboot.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Change PCIe mode in BIOS from Auto or PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 3.</p>
                    <p>Diagnosis: It seems like the problem was caused by using a PCIe Gen 3 riser cable with a PCIe Gen 4 Motherboard slot.</p>
                    <p>System Information: X570 AORUS ELITE, Ryzen 7 3700X, EVGA RTX 3070TI FTW3, Lian Li PC011 Dynamic (Source of Riser Cable)</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Intermittent BSOD / Blue Screen System Crashes with Ryzen 5 3600</h3>
                    <p>Problem: System will crash at random with various error codes, requiring full system reboot.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Change Windows power plan from Ryzen (Balanced) to Balanced.</p>
                    <p>Diagnosis: Looks like an issue with the AMD-supplied power plans causes the CPU unit to crash. Changing to a windows power plan such as High Performance or Balanced reduces BSOD frequency drastically.</p>
                    <p>System Information: B350M PRO VDH, Ryzen 5 3600, EVGA RTX 2060 Super XC ULTRA</p>

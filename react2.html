                <p>Welcome back! It's time for another tutorial with our favourite Javascript library:</p>
            </div>
                <hr>
                <h2>React.js</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>React is maintained by Meta. I've been learning it using various resources, namely free resources like YouTube tutorials, and the official tutorial on the Reactjs.org website.</p>
                <p>On this page, I am once again going to attempt to show you what I've learned and help you get a grasp on React as painlessly as possible. </p>
                <p>Originally, I began working on this blog post moments after finishing the first one. However, once I read the feedback I received on my first post, I decided to start over and take this tutorial in a slightly different direction.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>What is the most important part of designing UI?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>This has been the big question I've been asking myself as I continue to learn and practice React.</p>
                <p>After all, React is primarily made for developing objectively good UI that is easy to adjust and maintain. So, in this blog post I wanted to review what exactly makes a User Interface "good", and how we can use React to build UI that the everyday user will like.</p>
                <p>There's some basic concepts we're all familiar with that most blog platforms take care of automatically:
                    <br>
                    <br>Colours need to be contrasted properly so that it's easily readable for the user. To my knowledge, most platforms like Medium will just color the background with a blinding white (dark mode is a thing, guys. WHY???) so that the black-coloured text is juxtaposed against it.
                    <br>
                    <br>The UI needs to be responsive, so that a user on any kind of device with all sorts of different display sizes can still read your website. The next time you're browsing a website on your phone, try hitting the "Desktop Site" button. You might be surprised how many things are different about the layout.
                    <br>
                    <br>The website itself should provide you with all the options you may want as the user, so for example, if you're on this page but want to see a cute picture of my cat, you should be able to able to navigate to <button onclick="window.open('index.html','_blank');">jolan.dev</button> at the click of a button.</p>
                    <p>That said, I've come to realize the most important thing about designing UI is getting and then acting upon user feedback. Having actual, real people use your website, and then say, "Yeah, this sucks." is immensely valuable.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Where did I go wrong?</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I'll be honest - my ego was a little bit hurt when I read the feedback for my first blog post. I felt I did a pretty good job with my styling choices, but there was still a lot of criticism for certain things.</p>
                <p>There were some people that didn't like that the text on the page is all center-justified, which is a super easy fix, and honestly, pretty understandable. I thought about how most articles you read online, or really, most text on the internet in general, tends to be left-justified. After some thinking, I decided that left-justified is probably the way to go from now on. Makes the site feel a bit more natural, I think.</p>
                <p>Another minor criticism was about the colour choices. The background I use is a color fade from #614385 to #516395, which is a nice dark purple to a dark sky blue. To me, these colours are pleasing, but I suppose there's a reason most websites are either white or black.</p>
                <p>What people REALLY didn't like, was the drop shadow behind the text. When I wrote the CSS for my site, I thought that having drop shadow would be a cool stylistic choice that would also improve readability - as it turns out, it was distracting. I decided we're going to get rid of it, regardless of the fact that I like it. The user is the priority.</p>
                <p>Obviously, constructive criticism is exactly what it says it is - constructive. So, in the interest of building a better blog that users will hopefully like more than the first time, I decided to that this second post will focus on improving the layout and readability of this very page - and naturally, we've gotta do it with React. </p>

                <h2>Let's get started.</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Do me a favour, and try these buttons below.</h3>

                <div class="tableRow">
                    <div class="column" id="ChangeJust">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column" id="ChangeShadow">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column" id="ChangeBackColour">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="welcomeback">There you go, okay? I'm a benevolent god. You're welcome. (I'm kidding)</p>
                
                <h3>But how???</h3>
                <p>I know right? it's actually pretty sweet. We're using React which is a Javascript library, which uses JSX, which is HTML inside Javascript, to insert Inline CSS into our HTML. It's a beautiful interplay of all these technologies coming together to form something even greater... or something.</p>
                <p>I'm assuming you read the first blog post, so I'm going to skip a bit of the review and basics that we covered in the first post and jump straight into these new components.</p>
                <p>There are three components in play here. We have the <mark>ChangeJust</mark> component, which grabs all the text except for certain classes and headers and changes the <mark>text-align</mark> property from center to left.</p>
                <p>Next we have the <mark>ChangeShadow</mark> component, which grabs all text except certain elements like buttons and highlighted text and changes the <mark>text-shadow</mark> property from black to none.</p>
                <p>Last, and the one that gave me the most trouble, is the <mark>ChangeBackColour</mark> component. This component specifically uses some good ol' vanilla Javascript to change the <mark>background-image</mark> property of the entire body tag. This one was tricky.</p>
                    
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-jsx">
                                
                            class LearnReact extends React.Component {
                                constructor(props){
                                    super(props);
                                    this.state = {
                                        clickMe: false
                                    }
                                }
                            </code>
                        </pre>
